# CustomBoundary

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CustomBoundary is to generate required input files for the CASTool when using a custom (non-state) boundary.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CustomBoundary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("laura-naslund/CustomBoundary")
```

## Generate files

To generate files, provide the file paths 1) the location of the custom boundary geospatial file (e.g., .shp or .geojson), 2) desired output directory, 3) the region name in quotation marks that corresponds to the custom boundary. 

generateFiles(inputFilePath, outputFolder, region_name)

Additional parameters can be provided to the clustering algorithm script (e.g., to override the default settings).

## Output
generateFiles() will create 1) an rda file with the custom boundary, 2) a csv file assigning NHDPlus V2 reaches within the custom boundary to a cluster, 3) an rda file with NHDPlus V2 reach geometry, 4) a png file with a map of cluster results and PCA graphics, and 5) a ClusterOutput subfolder with additional files clustering-related files.
